Under is the requisite documentation for the said project:


START - 10th April:
	-> Flask study and understanding of the scope of the requirements
	-> Started to build the web app
	-> Looked up the repos and the websites for the NLP experiment that we have been assigned and a test experiment from the computer organisation lab to understand the requirements of the new design
	-> Build the layout html file for the experiment design.

11 - 13 th April:
	-> Used the {% extend %} command from flask to extend the layout to all the requisite html files from the experiment page
	-> Built the actual specific content from specific pages of the experiment such as the introduction, theory, procedure, further readings.
	-> Fixed all the broken links with the Vleads page for content not found.

14th April:
	-> Images were not visible despite the links looking correct.
	-> Recorrected the path under a static folder to make the images work.

15th -16th April:
	-> Study of the working of the experiment and the quiz page.
	-> The experiment page has been given a front end using flask and the back end part used javaScript to check the user answers.
	-> The quiz front end interface has mostly been ported as it is into flask. However, appropriate fields have been cleverly
		added to allow the user to enter, submit and store the answers.
	-> The quiz backend is more involved. It uses a combination of flask, python, sqlalchemy to create a database table for all the answers.
		So, the user, after entering all the answers, clicks on  submit, the "quizzes/submit" action is invoked. It adds a new row to the
		table and stores the answers along with an id for that answer. If any of the fields has been left unanswered, there are appropriate
		default values in place to fill up that spot in the table.

18th April:
	-> Updated the documentation file and wrapped up the project.
	-> Fixed Indentation and javascript.

19th April:
	-> Fixed some minor last minute bugs.
	-> Implemented a unit testing mechanism to check if all the pages are loading as per expectations.
	-> Finalised the README , Documentation files.
